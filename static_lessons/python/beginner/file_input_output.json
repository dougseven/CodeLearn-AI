This is essential for data persistence and processing.\n\n## Concept Overview\nPython provides built-in functions to work with files:\n- `open()`: Opens a file and returns a file object\n- `read()/write()`: Read from or write to a file\n- `close()`: Close the file when done\n\n## Syntax\n```python\n# Basic file reading\nwith open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n    content = file.read()\n    print(content)\n```\n\n```python\n# Basic file writing\nwith open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n    file.write('Hello, World!')\n```\n\n## Key Points\n- Always use the `with` statement to automatically close files\n- Common file modes: 'r' (read), 'w' (write), 'a' (append)\n- Use proper error handling for file operations\n- Files should be closed after use\n\n## Common Mistakes\n- Forgetting to close files\n- Not handling file not found errors\n- Using wrong file paths\n- Not encoding text properly\n\n## Practice\nTry reading a file line by line:\n```python\nwith open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n    for line in file:\n        print(line.strip())\n```",

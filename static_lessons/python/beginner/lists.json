    "lesson": "# Python Lists\n\n## Introduction\nLists are one of Python's most fundamental data structures. They allow you to store multiple items in a single variable and are mutable (can be changed after creation).\n\n## Concept Overview\nA list is an ordered collection of items that can be of different types (integers, strings, objects, etc.). Lists are created using square brackets [] and items are separated by commas.\n\n## Syntax\n```python\n# Creating and accessing lists\nfruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']\nprint(fruits[0])  # prints 'apple'\nfruits.append('grape')  # adds 'grape' to the end\n```\n\n```python\n# List operations\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nnumbers.insert(0, 0)  # insert at beginning\nnumbers.pop()  # remove last item\nprint(len(numbers))  # get length\n```\n\n## Key Points\n- Lists are ordered and indexed from 0\n- Lists can contain items of different types\n- Lists are mutable (can be modified)\n- Common methods: append(), insert(), remove(), pop()\n- Slicing works like: list[start:end:step]\n\n## Common Mistakes\n- Forgetting that index starts at 0\n- Trying to access an index that doesn't exist\n- Confusing append() and extend()\n- Not making a copy when needed (lists are mutable)\n\n## Practice\nTry these exercises:\n```python\n# Create a list of numbers 1-5\n# Reverse the list\n# Add a number to the beginning\n# Remove the last element\n```",
    "challenge": "def process_list(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create a function that takes a list of numbers and:\n    1. Removes all duplicate numbers\n    2. Sorts the list in ascending order\n    3. Returns the sum of the first and last number\n    \n    If the list is empty, return 0\n    If the list has only one number, return that number\n    \"\"\"\n    pass",

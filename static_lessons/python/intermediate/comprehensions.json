They're a powerful feature that can replace loops and make code more readable.\n\n## Concept Overview\nA comprehension is a compact way to process all or part of an iterable and create a new sequence. Python supports list, dict, and set comprehensions.\n\n## Syntax\n```python\n# List comprehension\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquares = [x**2 for x in numbers]  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n\n# With conditional\neven_squares = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]  # [4, 16]\n```\n\n```python\n# Dict comprehension\nnames = ['alice', 'bob', 'charlie']\nname_lengths = {name: len(name) for name in names}\n# {'alice': 5, 'bob': 3, 'charlie': 7}\n```\n\n## Key Points\n- Comprehensions make code more readable and concise\n- They can include conditions (if statements)\n- Available for lists, dictionaries, and sets\n- Can process any iterable (lists, tuples, strings, etc.)\n\n## Common Mistakes\n- Using comprehensions for complex operations that would be clearer with a loop\n- Nesting too many comprehensions\n- Forgetting that comprehensions create new objects\n\n## Practice\nTry these exercises:\n```python\n# Convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit\ncelsius = [0, 10, 20, 30]\n# Create fahrenheit list using comprehension\n\n# Create a dict of number:square pairs for numbers 1-5\n# Example: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, ...}\n```",

It's the core mechanism that prevents common programming errors like null or dangling pointer references.\n\n## Concept Overview\n\nRust's ownership system has three main rules:\n1. Each value in Rust has an 'owner'\n2. There can only be one owner at a time\n3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped\n\n## Syntax Examples\n\n```rust\n// Basic ownership example\nfn main() {\n    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\"); // s1 owns the string\n    let s2 = s1; // ownership moves to s2, s1 is no longer valid\n    // println!(\"{}\", s1); // This would cause a compile-time error\n}\n```\n\n```rust\n// Borrowing example\nfn main() {\n    let s = String::from(\"hello\");\n    let len = calculate_length(&s); // Borrowing the value\n}\n\nfn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {\n    s.len()\n}\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Ownership is transferred by default\n- Borrowing allows temporary access without transferring ownership\n- References can be mutable or immutable\n- The compiler checks ownership rules at compile-time\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- Trying to use a value after its ownership has been moved\n- Creating multiple mutable references to the same data\n- Attempting to modify a borrowed value without permission\n\n## Practice Exercises\n\n```rust\n// Try implementing a function that demonstrates ownership transfer\nfn transfer_ownership(s: String) -> String {\n    // Your implementation here\n}\n```\n\nHint: Create a function that takes a String, does something with it, and returns the modified String.",
    "challenge": "// Ownership Challenge\n\n// Create a function that demonstrates ownership transfer and borrowing\n// Requirements:\n// 1. Create a function that takes ownership of a String\n// 2. Modify the string\n// 3. Return the modified string\n// 4. Implement a borrowing function that calculates the length\n\nfn main() {\n    // Your implementation here\n}",
